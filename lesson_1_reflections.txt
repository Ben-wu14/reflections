How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It help you to noticed the changes that were made to the file which makes it easier for you to find out the mistake

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you want to restore the old version of your file which you hardly remember what is it like.It will be very convenient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It's better to create a commit manually, because you can create the commit whenever there is a logical change. It's easier for the programmer to fix the bug in the future. If the versions are saved automatically the information will be clutterd.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes the files are connected to each other, one changes in a single file may cause another file to change.In Google Docs, documents are no relevant to each other so they can be treated seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to view all the commits and use git diff to compare two commits with their ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    There is a command call 'git checkout' that helps you to go back to the previous version of your file.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
