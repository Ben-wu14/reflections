When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to share your project with others or you are working on the project as a team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you don't need to updates from your remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone a repository from others to your repository in Github
    Clones copy the repository from the web to your machine
    Branches created in your repository 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps you to find out the different between the one in your computer and the one in Github

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'll have to do it by talk to others and sharing the whole project online.
    It will be easier to fix the conflic but it will be harder to save the older version of the project and work together on seperate field

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you are working on a different part of the project, and you want to collaberate with your friends before you pull it into the offical version.
